## Introduction

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have control over your data. This Privacy Policy outlines what data we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to safeguard your information. We believe in transparency – no tricks, just straightforward information. This policy applies to both the Jan desktop app and website.

## 1. Data Collection and Consent

### Explicit Consent

<Callout type="info">
  We do not collect any data until you explicitly allow tracking.
</Callout>

### Tracking Preferences

Upon first launching the app or visiting the website, you will be prompted to set your tracking preferences. These preferences can be modified at any time via the app's Settings menu or the website's Privacy Settings.

### Legal Basis

<Callout>
For users in regions governed by GDPR, we process data based on your explicit consent ([GDPR Article 6(1)(a)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)). This means:

- We only process your data after receiving clear, affirmative consent
- You can withdraw your consent at any time through Settings
- Withdrawing consent will stop all optional data collection
- Your withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing before its withdrawal
</Callout>

## 2. Data We Do Not Collect

Regardless of your analytics permissions, Jan will never access the following:

- **Chat History**: Your conversations with Jan are private and inaccessible to us.
- **Chat Settings**: Your personalized settings remain solely with you.
- **Language Models**: The specific language models you use are not tracked.

## 3. Purpose of Data Collection

To build a reliable and user-friendly AI that you own, understanding how Jan is used is essential. If you permit tracking, we collect product analytics data to:

- **Improve User Experience**: Enhance app functionality based on usage patterns.
- **Measure Engagement**: Assess active users and retention rates to ensure ongoing value.

## 4. Product Analytics

### Data Collected

When you opt-in to tracking, we collect the following anonymous data:

- **Active Users**: Number of daily active users to gauge engagement.
- **Retention Rates**: Track if users continue to find value in Jan over time.

### Data Anonymity

<Callout>
  - **User ID**: Analytics data is tied to a randomly generated user ID, ensuring no link to your personal identity.
  - **Privacy Assurance**: Your chat history and personal data are never tracked or linked to your usage data.
</Callout>

## 5. What We Don't Track

Even with analytics permissions granted, Jan does not track:

- **Conversations**: Your interactions with Jan remain private.
- **Files**: We do not scan, upload, or view your files.
- **Personal Identity**: No collection of data tied to your personal identity.
- **Prompts**: Your prompts and prompt templates are not monitored.
- **Conversation Metrics**: We do not track context length or conversation length.
- **Model Usage**: The specific models you use or their types are not tracked.
- **Storage**: You retain full control over storing your files and logs, prioritizing your privacy.

## 6. Using Cloud Models

Jan allows connection to cloud-based model APIs (e.g., GPT, Claude models).

<Callout type="info">
  **Important Points:**
  - **Data Handling**: The API provider processes your messages directly; Jan does not access or store these messages.
  - **Local Models**: Choosing local models ensures all data remains on your device, with no external access—even by us.
</Callout>

## 7. Data Storage and Processing

### Analytics Provider

We use PostHog EU for analytics, ensuring all data is processed within the European Union.

### Data Security

- **Encryption**: All data transfers are encrypted using TLS to ensure secure transmission.
- **Storage**: PostHog securely manages the data we collect. For more information, refer to PostHog's GDPR documentation.

## 8. Data Retention

- **Retention Period**: Analytics data is retained for up to 12 months unless otherwise required by law.
- **Deletion Requests**: You can request the deletion of your analytics data at any time by contacting us.

## 9. Your Rights and Choices

- **Access and Control**: You can access, modify, or delete your tracking preferences at any time through the app or website settings.
- **Data Requests**: For any requests related to your data, please contact us using the information provided below.

## 10. Children's Privacy

<Callout type="warning">
  Jan does not target or knowingly collect data from children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your region). If we become aware of any such data, it will be promptly deleted.
</Callout>
