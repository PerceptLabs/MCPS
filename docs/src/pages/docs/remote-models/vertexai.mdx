# VertexAI API

<Callout type='info'>
The VertexAI Extension can be used select models that [support the openai endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/call-vertex-using-openai-library) on vertexAI's.
</Callout>

## How to Integrate VertexAI API with Jan
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating the VertexAI API with Jan, allowing users to utilize VertexAI's capabilities within Jan's conversational interface.

## Integration Steps
<Steps>
### Step 1: Configure GCP Service Account
1. Open the [Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) in GCP
2. Select your project
3. Create Credentials -> Service Account
4. Give your service account a name
5. Give at least the "Vertex AI Online Prediction Service Agent" role
6. Click on the account, then the "Keys" tab
7. Create new key -> select json.
8. Copy the exact project id, private key id, private key, and client email into your JAN configuration.
9. Set the region to what is appropriate for your instance

### Step 2: Start Chatting with the Model

1. Select the VertexAI model you want to use.
2. Specify the model's parameters.
3. Start the conversation with the VertexAI model.
</Steps>

### VertexAI Models

You can also use specific VertexAI models you cannot find in the **Hub** section by customizing the `model.yaml` file, which you can see in the `~/jan/data/models/`. Follow the steps in the [Manage Models](/docs/models/manage-models) to manually add a model.

<Callout type='info'>
- You can find the list of available models in the [VertexAI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/call-vertex-using-openai-library).
- The `id` property must match the model name in the list.
  - For example, if you want to use the Gemini 1.0 Pro model you must set the `id` property to `google/gemini-1.0-pro-002`.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the integration process or while using VertexAI with Jan, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Double-check your service account is active.
- Confirm the model you selected is available in your selected region.
- Ensure the model is enabled in VertexAI model garden.
- Check for error messages or logs that may provide insight into the issue.
