# Jan Beta Builds

Welcome to Jan's beta program! Beta builds give you early access to new features and improvements before they reach the stable release. By participating in the beta program, you can help shape the future of Jan by providing feedback and reporting issues.

<Callout type="warning">
Beta builds may contain bugs and unstable features. We recommend using the stable release for production environments.
