## Major Changes

### 1. Core Engine Update
Migrated from llama.cpp (Nitro) to llama.cpp (Cortex) as Jan's core engine

**Note about model compatibility from v0.5.8:**

When you update to v0.5.8 > Download models in this version > Then downgrade to versions before v0.5.8:
- Some models may temporarily not appear in the app due to configuration format changes (model.json â†’ model.yaml), while the model files remain safe and are not deleted
- You can re-import your existing models after downgrading
When upgrading back to 0.5.8+, all your models will be compatible again

### 2. Version Management Enhancement
- Separated installation channels: Stable, Beta, and Nightly versions can now be installed independently
- **Important**: Existing Nightly users will be automatically migrated to Stable (from `v0.5.8`)
- New Nightly builds will be purely for testing purposes, primarily for internal team and contributors

## UI/UX Improvements 
- Added model ID display in Local API Server
- Reduced animation effects for better performance
- Auto-focus on chat input box when opening threads
- Reduced aggressive blur effect on modals for better visibility
- Enhanced system monitor interface
- Expanded clickable areas of icon button for better interaction
- Improved text alignment for model lists
- Fixed inconsistent left panel background in responsive mode
- Fixed various edge cases with chat input behavior & syntax highlighting
- Fixed slate React version compatibility

## Other Improvements
- Removed deprecated model `GPT-4 with Vision (Preview)`
- Added model `Qwen2.5 Coder (14b/32b)`
- CUDA dependencies are now included by default for improved onboarding experience
